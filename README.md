# .NET Demo Requirement Page
This is a project to track all efforts for a .NET demo regarding DevSecOps and CI/CD pipelines within Maturity Level 1 as follows:

## ML 1​

### Planning & Tracking​
Manual practices defined with possible use of legacy rudimentary tools to collect and store information​
### Configuration Management​
All supporting artifacts and configuration items along with the level of configuration control that require configuration control are identified and documented​
### Solution Development​
Development activities and tools are identified and documented that will support the edit, compile, and source control of code​ 
### Integration​
Identification and use of documented, repeatable, processes that may be manual, automated, or a combination of the two. ​
### Verification & Validation​
All stakeholders/product owners, testing cases, procedures, and their artifacts are identified​
### Deployment​
Legacy system is reviewed for recovery if a failure occurs in a deployed product, deploying the product at the last known working state​
### Monitor & Control​
The level of monitoring and control for each supporting artifact and implementation are identified and defined; baseline determined​
### Hosting Services​
Current hosting environment is reviewed, and sustainment elements are identified  along with applicable new hosting environment identified and architected (if current hosting service is not adequate) for supporting SDLC phases​
### Software Assurance​
Software assurance processes and tools are inventoried, and policies and procedures are reviewed/updated to meeting compliance requirements​
### Quality Assurance​
Policies and procedures are developed and documented to describe how the DevSecOps processes and tools are required to be used to meet all relevant requirements

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a CI/CD pipeline that consists of DevSecOps prinicples using a simple .NET application to obtain lessons learned with GitLab and to be able to demonstrate DevSecOps to Nexagen customers.
